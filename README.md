My name is Haris Hassan and I am an Applied Scientist currently based in Pisa Italy. I am interested in IOT, data science, web development, scientific research, and real world applied projects. I am also fascinated by data visualisation and analysis.

In my spare time, I travel. While travelling, I process life and scientific ideas.
